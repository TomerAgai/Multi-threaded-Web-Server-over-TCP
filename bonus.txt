Bonus Feature: Dynamic Directory Listing

The server has been enhanced with a feature that dynamically generates and serves directory listings. When a client requests access to a directory path that exists on the server's root, instead of returning a "Forbidden" error, the server now generates a simple HTML page listing all the files and directories within the requested directory. Each listed item is a hyperlink, allowing the client to navigate deeper into the file structure or directly access files. This feature improves the usability of the server by providing a way to browse the server's content directly from a web browser, without prior knowledge of the server's file structure.
In addition, we added support to more content types such as: .mp4, .pdf, .doc and more.

Implementation Details:
- The `ContentServer` class's `serveStaticContent` method was modified to check if the requested path is a directory.
- If the requested path is a directory, the server generates an HTML page listing the contents of the directory.
- Each item in the listing is a hyperlink that allows the user to navigate the server's file structure interactively.
- This feature supports both viewing and navigating directories, enhancing the server's functionality and making it more user-friendly.
- The 'getContentType' method under 'ResponseUtility' class, was modified to compare with more content types.
